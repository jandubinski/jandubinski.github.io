I work on developing safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence. My research focuses on generative models, including large language models and generative vision systems. I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the Doctoral School of Warsaw University of Technology, where I explore how to make these technologies more reliable and aligned with human values.
